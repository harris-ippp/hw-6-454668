The American energy sector has experienced enormous technological innovation over the past decade in everything from renewables (solar and wind power), to extraction (hydraulic fracturing), to storage (advanced batteries), to consumer efficiency (advanced thermostats).

After more than 60 years of operation, the nearly 100 light water reactors (LWRs) operating in the U.S. supply nearly 20% of the U.S's electrical generation and 64% of its carbon-free electricity. These plants are a critical element in the low-carbon emissions energy mix that must remain in operation, and they are an American technological and technical accomplishment to be proud of. But what’s the next step in nuclear power’s evolution? Just as some companies require supercomputers and other companies require laptops, the next generation of nuclear engineers are designing advanced and innovative reactors to provide different types of power for the very different energy needs around the globe.
